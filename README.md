The Bhadra-Kilgore Block is a method of electrical stimulation hypothesized to be able to stimulate neurons as a means to address chronic pain without the use of opiod medication. This project targeted Deep Root Ganglion neurons in the lower spinal column to attempt and target pain receptors that correlate to chronic pain throughout different parts of the human body.

The project is particularly meaningful to me as my mother suffers from chronic pain as a result of a drunk driver hit-and-run we were invovled in during August of 2019.
